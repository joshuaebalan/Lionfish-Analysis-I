# Lionfish-Analysis-I
Purdue Univ. Lionfish Research Project. WORK IN PROGRESS

This is intended for use for the analysis of invasive lionfish culling in Tom's Caye, Placencia, Belize with data from ReefCI, an ecotourism company aiming towards conservation.

### Background:
Lionfish are an invasive species in the Carribean, especially surrounding tropical coral reefs. They are native to the tropical waters of the equatorial Pacific in which they have natural predators. However, they are the apex predators here in the East, due to their unnatural origin. First sighted in 2008 by various dive crews, lionfish have become generealistic in their diet, with the current understanding that they "eat anything they can fir in their mouths", according to ReefCI. The most problematic part of this is their culling of the parrotfish population, a keystone species that indirectly ensures the reefs are not snuffed out in their light competition with algae species. 

In Placencia specifically, the first invasive lionfish were sighted in 2009, and ReefCI has been killing them ever since. They have also been dissecting them for years, and keeping careful log of the data, which this project hopes to use for greater understanding of their efforts.

### Project Goal:
This project aims to accomplish the following:
1. Identify trends in the data
2. Attempt to use current scientific understanding to explain trends away
3. Should an unexplainable trend exist, further investigate and potentially organize an experiment for ReefCI.

### Key People/Thanks to:
1. Dr. Greg Michalski, main advisor
2. Willie, ReefCI in-house marine biologist and owner of the dataset used in this project
3. Dr. Jeff Turkstra, for his advice in technical elements of this project
